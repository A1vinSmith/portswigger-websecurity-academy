# Writeup PortSwigger WebSecurity Academy

This repo contains my writeups and scripts for solving the [PortSwigger WebSecurity Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security). I plan to follow the learning path provided by PortSwigger. Only time will tell what I will actually do :)

## Ressources

PortSwigger has very nice learning resources on their website. Basically, everything required to get started is there.

For a nice video series I can recommend the video series of [Rana Khalil](https://www.youtube.com/c/RanaKhalil101/playlists) on youtube. At the current time, she uploaded videos that cover SQL Injection and CSRF, but she shows everything she does and explains very nicely. And she uploads a new lab video each week (roughly), so I'm sure over time she will cover the full content of the WebSecurity Academy.
